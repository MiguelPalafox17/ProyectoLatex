\begin{justifying}
  \noindent So far we have not dealt with change. But, if we are to believe science,
we must uphold the ontological postulate that all things are in flux. In
fact the sciences describe, explain, predict, control or elicit changes of
various kinds - such as motion, accretion, division, and evolution.
Therefore ontology should analyze and systematize these various types
of change.
